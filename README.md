# xml-project

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML files is a common format to transfer data across the internet gained its popularity in the early days of the web due to the vast similarity with HTML syntax. Now, a better alternative is JSON format which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Both of these formats are used to send data in HTTP requests. Due to the similarity with HTML, we will adopt the DOM - Document Object Model - model used in modern browsers by parsing the file as a tree and applying different operations as needed by the user.


In our Project, we are implementing an XML Editor that can do the following:

-	Check the XML consistency and Fixing errors
-	Format (Prettify) the XML file
-	Convert XML to JSON
- Minify the XML file
- Compress & Decompress the data in the XML/JSON file
- Representing the users data using the Graph data structure
- GUI

### * We used *Graphviz* library to visualize the graph on the GUI.
### * We used *Qt Creator* to implement the GUI.
